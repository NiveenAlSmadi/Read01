After finished the previous 2 classes and read the documents attached, i came with this summary so here we go : 
first of all we learn how to deal with sth new was name linux , simply linux is a  graphical user interface , so we deal with this software by commands lines as we know 
so we learn about commands line and is a text based interface to the system , i mentionend there some of new line commans for me :
1)~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory. eg, .2)ls List the contents of a directory. 3) /etc - Stores config files for the system. 4)ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

Then , i read about Basic Navigation, learn the basics of moving around the system, learn a  pwd which stands for Print Working Directory.then move to sth new which about Relative and Absolute paths ,simply :Relative path is  A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system on the other hand Absolute path is :A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
  
at the end i will present a simple Comparison of “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDEAs requested :

Tool
 – Code editor is one of the most important tools for programmers specifically designed to enhance and ease of process of code editing. A code editor is basically a text editor and so much more.

 Code editors are text editors with powerful built-in features and specialized functionalities to simplify and accelerate code editing process. An IDE, on the other hand, is a set of software development tools designed to make coding easier. It combines the different aspects of a computer program into a single GUI, simplifying the whole software development process.

Functionality 
– An IDE is a text editor, a code editor, a debugger, compiler and more all under a single tool belt. It consolidates many of the functions like code creation, building and testing, together in a single framework, service or application, allowing you to work on different modules of the same project effortlessly in an organized manner. 

A code editor can either be a standalone software program or part of an IDE or web browser. It helps you color your code and provides you more advanced tools to make coding easier for you.
